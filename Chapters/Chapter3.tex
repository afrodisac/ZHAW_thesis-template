\section{Classical Approaches}

There are many different approaches to tackle flood modeling. They include Rapid flood spreading, 1D surface, 1D sewer, 1D-1D coupled, 2D surface and 1D-2D coupled \cite{bulti2020review}. The objectives of this thesis are to model the dynamics and inundation of a flood plain in 2D. Therefore only 2D modeling techniques will be mentioned.

\subsection*{Rapid Flood Spreading} 

Rapid Flood Spreading (RFS)\footnote{The RFS method description has been summarized from \citeauthor{liu2010new} \cite{liu2010new}}, as the name implies, is a simple model to rapidly predict inundation of the flood plain. It works by equalizing the water levels of cells within a local neighbourhood. There are two stages to this process: The pre-calculation and inundation routine. In the pre-calculation routine, low points are identified in the DEM and expanded outwards. In the inundation routine, water is distributed from the inflow source to neighbouring cells using a lowest neighbour principle.

	
\subsection*{Two-Dimensional Surface}
A 2D flood model represents the river network in a mesh, which provides information about the river topography and allows to define very precisely the topography of the floodplain. The hydraulics are solved using two-dimensional shallow  water equations: The continuity equation (Eq. \ref{eq:3.1}), and two-dimensional equations of motion (Eq. \ref{eq:3.2} and Eq. \ref{eq:3.3}) \cite{o1993two}.

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:3.1}
	\frac{\partial h}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial h V_{x}}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial h V_{y}}{\partial y} = 0
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:3.2}
	S_{fx} = S_{ox} - \frac{\partial h}{\partial x} - \frac{V_{x}}{g}\frac{\partial V_{x}}{\partial x} - \frac{V_{y}}{g}\frac{\partial V_{x}}{\partial y} - \frac{1}{g}\frac{\partial V_{x}}{\partial t} 
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:3.3}
	S_{fy} = S_{oy} - \frac{\partial h}{\partial y} - \frac{V_{y}}{g}\frac{\partial V_{y}}{\partial y} - \frac{V_{x}}{g}\frac{\partial V_{y}}{\partial x} - \frac{1}{g}\frac{\partial V_{x}}{\partial t} 
\end{equation}
% change the rest of the math 'where' to the following format:
Where, $h$ is flow depth; $g$ is gravitational acceleration; $V_{x}$ and $V_{y}$ are the depth-averaged  velocity components along the $x$ and $y$ coordinates; The friction slope components $S_{fx}$ and $S_{fy}$ are a function of the bed slope $S_{ox}$ and $S_{oy}$, pressure gradient, convective and local acceleration terms. However, the diffusive wave approximation to this equation is defined by neglecting the latter three terms. \\
2D surface models have the advantage of being able to model dynamics of the flood plain, duration and are very accurate.
 
\subsection*{The Problem With Classical Approaches}
RFS is an extremely fast modeling scheme but comes with some major drawbacks. The can only show the final state of inundation and does not describe information about the flood. 2D surface models require fine resolution data and extremely computationally demanding. They can take hours to run and are only able to model small areas. Both of these methods have rather large drawbacks. Especially when unpredictable rainfall events occur and rapid modeling of a flood plain is required to prevent catastrophe.

\section{The CA Approach}
The advantage of employing CA for flood modeling is its simplicity \cite{Wolfram2002} and computational speed. It has the advantage of utilizing local functions for computation. Older 2D CA models, although much faster than solving complete shallow water equations still had to solve complicated, computationally demanding equations.
\subsection{The Weighted Cellular Automata Model}
The following is an overview of the paper titled \citetitle{guidolin2016weighted}  by \citeauthor{guidolin2016weighted} \footnote{\cite{guidolin2016weighted}}. This work is an improvement on the previous CA2D model (A short literature review can be found in Appendix \ref{AppendixC}). This thesis utilized data simulated by the weighted Cellular Automata 2D (WCA2D) for training and validation of deep learning models.\\

\citeauthor{Ghimire}'s paper improved on previous CADDIES-2D model in that instead of solving Manning equation for the computation of interfacial discharges between cells
