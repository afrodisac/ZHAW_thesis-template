abstract = {With the increase in frequency and severity of flash flood events in major cities around the world, the infrastructure and people living in those urban areas are exposed continuously to high risk levels of pluvial flooding. The situation is likely to be exacerbated by the potential impact of future climate change. A fast flood model could be very useful for flood risk analysis. One-dimensional (1D) models provide limited information about the flow dynamics whereas two-dimensional (2D) models require substantial computational time and cost, a factor that limits their use. This paper presents an alternative approach using cellular automata (CA) for 2D modelling. The model uses regular grid cells as a discrete space for the CA setup and applies generic rules to local neighbourhood cells to simulate the spatio-temporal evolution of pluvial flooding. The proposed CA model is applied to a hypothetical terrain and a real urban area. The synchronous state updating rule and inherent nature of the proposed model contributes to a great reduction in computational time. The results are compared with a hydraulic model and good agreement is found between the two models.},

	abstract = {Identifying and characterizing vascular plants in time and space is required in various disciplines, e.g. in forestry, conservation and agriculture. Remote sensing emerged as a key technology revealing both spatial and temporal vegetation patterns. Harnessing the ever growing streams of remote sensing data for the increasing demands on vegetation assessments and monitoring requires efficient, accurate and flexible methods for data analysis. In this respect, the use of deep learning methods is trend-setting, enabling high predictive accuracy, while learning the relevant data features independently in an end-to-end fashion. Very recently, a series of studies have demonstrated that the deep learning method of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is very effective to represent spatial patterns enabling to extract a wide array of vegetation properties from remote sensing imagery. This review introduces the principles of CNN and distils why they are particularly suitable for vegetation remote sensing. The main part synthesizes current trends and developments, including considerations about spectral resolution, spatial grain, different sensors types, modes of reference data generation, sources of existing reference data, as well as CNN approaches and architectures. The literature review showed that CNN can be applied to various problems, including the detection of individual plants or the pixel-wise segmentation of vegetation classes, while numerous studies have evinced that CNN outperform shallow machine learning methods. Several studies suggest that the ability of CNN to exploit spatial patterns particularly facilitates the value of very high spatial resolution data. The modularity in the common deep learning frameworks allows a high flexibility for the adaptation of architectures, whereby especially multi-modal or multi-temporal applications can benefit. An increasing availability of techniques for visualizing features learned by CNNs will not only contribute to interpret but to learn from such models and improve our understanding of remotely sensed signals of vegetation. Although CNN has not been around for long, it seems obvious that they will usher in a new era of vegetation remote sensing.}
